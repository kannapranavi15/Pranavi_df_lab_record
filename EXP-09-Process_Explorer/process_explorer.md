###  Step 1: Download and Launch Process Explorer

1. **Download Process Explorer:**  
   Visit the official Microsoft Sysinternals website and download **Process Explorer**. 

2. **Extract Files:**  
   Unzip the downloaded file into a specific folder on your system. 

3. **Run as Administrator:**  
   Right-click on `procexp64.exe` (for 64-bit) or `procexp.exe` (for 32-bit) ‚Üí **Run as Administrator** to launch the tool.

###  Step 2: Understanding the Interface

When launched, Process Explorer shows a **tree view** of running processes. Each process is color-coded based on its type or activity status:

| **Color** | **Meaning** |
|------------|-------------|
| ü©∑ **Pink** | Suspended processes |
| üîµ **Light Blue** | User-level processes |
| üü¶ **Dark Blue** | System processes or services |
| üü¢ **Green** | Newly created processes |
| üî¥ **Red** | Recently terminated processes |

These visual indicators make it easier to monitor and analyze system behavior in real time.

###  Step 3: Identifying Suspicious Processes

Follow these steps to investigate any suspicious or unknown processes:

1. **Check Unknown Names:**  
   Look for process names you don‚Äôt recognize. Legitimate processes usually belong to trusted vendors like *Microsoft*, *Intel*, or *Adobe*. 

2. **Verify Digital Signature:**  
   Right-click the process ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí **Image tab** ‚Üí check **Digital Signature**.  
   If no signature is found, it could be unsafe. 

3. **Inspect File Location:**  
   Check the **Path** field. Genuine Windows processes usually reside in:  
   `C:\Windows\System32\`  
   Files located in `Temp` or `User` folders may be malicious. 

4. **Monitor Resource Usage:**  
   Observe the **CPU**, **Memory**, and **Disk** usage.  
   High or unusual usage without reason could signal malware.   

5. **Check Description and Company Info:**  
   Missing or strange details under the **Description** or **Company Name** column can indicate a fake or harmful process. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  

6. **View Network Activity:**  
   Right-click ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí **TCP/IP tab** to check for unexpected internet connections.

### üîé Step 4: Research Suspicious Processes

If a process looks strange:

* Search its name online (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `svchost.exe`). 
* Check with trusted sources like **VirusTotal**, **ProcessLibrary**, or **Windows Defender Security Intelligence**. 

This helps confirm whether the process is safe, a system file, or malware.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Handling Malicious or Unwanted Processes

Once you identify a harmful process, take action:

* **Terminate:**  
  Right-click ‚Üí **Kill Process** to stop it immediately. 

* **Suspend:**  
  Right-click ‚Üí **Suspend** to temporarily freeze it. 

* **Locate and Delete Source File:**  
  Right-click ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí check the **Path**, navigate to the location, and delete the executable if confirmed malicious.

---

###  Step 6: Perform a System-Wide Cleanup

* Run a **full antivirus scan** using Windows Defender or any trusted antivirus software. 
* Use dedicated **malware removal tools** like *Malwarebytes* or *AdwCleaner* for deeper cleanup. 
* Restart your computer and verify that the suspicious process no longer appears.

### Final Output

| **Action** | **Result** |
|-------------|------------|
| Identified suspicious process | Process Explorer showed unknown process consuming high CPU |
| Verified digital signature | Process found unsigned and located in Temp directory |
| Killed and deleted process | Process terminated and file removed |
| Ran antivirus scan | No further threats detected |
| System status | Clean and stable  |
