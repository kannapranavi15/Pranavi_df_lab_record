# Ex.No.1 ‚Äî FTK Imager: Forensic Imaging Tool Overview

## Volatile Memory (RAM)

**Step 1:** Run FTK Imager as Administrator
Right-click FTK Imager ‚Üí Run as administrator

**Step 2:** Initiate Memory Capture
In the menu, go to File ‚Üí Capture Memory...
Opens the Memory Capture dialog.

**Step 3:** Configure Destination
Destination Path: Select an external drive (never the suspect system disk).
Destination Filename: Use default or give a descriptive case-based name.

**Step 4:** Start Capture
Click Capture Memory.
Progress depends on the system‚Äôs RAM size (e.g., 8GB ‚Üí few minutes).

**Step 5:** Completion
A progress bar will indicate capture status.
Once finished, a memory dump file (.mem/.bin) will be saved to the destination folder.
Note the log file generated.

## Non-Volatile Memory (Disk Image)

**step 1:** Run FTK Imager as Administrator
Right-click the FTK Imager icon ‚Üí Run as administrator
üìÅ Tip: Always use admin mode to ensure full disk access.

**Step 2:** Start Disk Imaging Process
In the menu bar, go to File ‚Üí Create Disk Image...
Opens the ‚ÄúCreate Image‚Äù dialog.

**Step 3:** Select Source Type
Source Type	Description
Physical Drive	Entire disk including partitions, unallocated space, and MBR
Logical Drive	Specific partition (e.g., C:)
Image File	Use if copying or converting an existing image
Folder Contents	Captures only a particular folder

**Step 4:** Select Source Drive
Connect the suspect disk through a hardware write-blocker (prevents accidental writes).
From the list of available drives, select the correct one.
Click Finish to proceed.

**Step 5:** Configure Destination
Click Add... ‚Üí choose Image Type and destination path.
Image Type	Description
E01	EnCase format, compressed, includes metadata and per-segment hashes (recommended)
Raw (DD)	Bit-for-bit copy, no compression, no extra metadata
AFF	Open forensic format, supports compression
Fill in Evidence Information (Case number, examiner name, description).
Image Fragment Size:
Enter 0 ‚Üí single file output
Or set a value (e.g., 2000 MB) to split into segments
Choose an external drive as Destination Path.

**Step 6:** Start Imaging
Before starting:
‚úÖ Check Verify images after creation
‚úÖ Check Calculate MD5/SHA1 hash
Click Start to begin imaging.
Process time depends on the drive size and speed (e.g., 1TB disk may take several hours).

**Step 7:** Completion and Hash Verification
When imaging completes, FTK Imager automatically compares the source drive hash with the image hash.
If the hashes match ‚Üí evidence integrity is confirmed.
Save the acquisition log file generated by FTK Imager.
